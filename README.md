This is a Dream Journal App. The app is to help a user document notes and have the data storted online via the cloud.

Using firebase i made an app where the user can add and delete notes and have that data updated on the firebase account.

    Features:

        (i) Child_added ( A js function that helps firebase know that a new data has been added. It give the code the opportunity to notify the user that the data has been added to                    the cloud)
        (ii) Child_removed ( Similiar to child_added, child removed helps firebase know that data has been removed and give the coder the opportunity to notify the user.)
        (iii) Snapshot ( A js handler that allow the firebase to provide a screen shot of current data in the databse, this helps the coder use the handler to display data in the app)
